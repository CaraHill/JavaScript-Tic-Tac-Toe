# JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe

## Learning Competencies

* Build a fully functional, JavaScript-heavy web application from scratch
* Use agile development techniques

## Summary
For this challenge, you're going to be writing a JavaScript-heavy codebase.
You'll need to keep it organized, readable, and tested. And you'll be doing
it in pairs.


## Releases
### Release 1: Deciding on your MVP

> * A user can see a board
> * A user can see a styled board
> * A user can place a piece in a column
> * Users place alternating pieces on the board (X and O or something of your own design)
> * Users can't place a piece in a filled space
> * Users are notified when they win the game
> * Users have the option to play against the computer
> * Users are notified when there is no possible way for either to win a game
> * Users and computers have a limited time to move
> * Users can play against each other in the same browser
> * Users can play against a "smart" computer, that has an algorithm for determining the optimal move.
> * Users can play against a super "smart" computer, that optimizes its moves by making projections for future moves
> * A user can play against another user on a different computer, using Firebase.js
> * A user can see a list of their records against the current opponent
> * Add your own user stories

Before you start coding, decide what your Minimum Viable Product is. What are the features that are absolutely necessary?
What features can you complete in the time you have?

***Declare your MVP in your README.md. This should be your first commit.*** As you finish sprints, you should update your README.md

### MVP:

> * Users are notified when they win the game

### Release 2: Build it!

It's time to build this thing. Start a repository on GitHub as a part of your cohort's organization and get to work.

Be intentional about your workflow. Are you going to work solo or in pairs? How
are you going to do to code review? How do you plan on communicating with each
other? How are you going to handle deployment? How are you going to split the
project up so that you aren't constantly overwriting each other's code?
